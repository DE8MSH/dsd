Linux ALSA Support

Recent distributions of Linux use PulseAudio. DSD needed the PulseAudio OSS
wrapper program (padsp) to work on those systems. Some people had problems
using padsp.

PulseAudio works better with ALSA, so ALSA support was added to DSD. ALSA
support is automatically included in the build step, if available on the
system.

The aplay -l command at a shell prompt will list ALSA devices.

~/dsd$ aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Hardware Devices ****
card 0: PCH [HDA Intel PCH], device 0: ALC269VC Analog [ALC269VC Analog]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
card 1: CODEC [USB Audio CODEC], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0

The ALSA device can be specified by using hw:<card>,<subdevice> on the command
line. To use the USB Audio CODEC in the sample above the following command
line could be used. The -i hw:1,0 option specifies card 1, subdevice 0.

~/dsd$ dsd -i hw:1,0
